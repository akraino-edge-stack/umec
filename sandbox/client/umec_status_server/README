The overall plan is the following:

1. Make a builder container that has rust installed
2. The builder mounts a local volume, compiles the given source code, and
stores it in the local volume. This way we can compile the apps with the right
versions
3. The umec container will mount these apps and be able to run them

The uMEC builder container works with 

sudo buildah bud --file builder-Dockerfile --format docker --tag umec_builder ./

The format must be docker to support the multi-stage build.

After this, the umec_container can be built with

sudo buildah bud --file umec-Dockerfile --format docker --tag umec_container ./
