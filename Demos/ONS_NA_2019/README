This part of the demo code is a web server written in Rust that uses

- The Rocket web server 
- Tera templates
- Skeleton style sheets

and the related Rust packages. It reads from an InfluxDB and allows to browse
it, to make it easy to find and show the information. The InfluxDB needs to
be running locally on port 8086, although it would be easy to change that.
Easiest way to get started with InfluxDB is to run it in a container:

docker run -p 8086:8086 --name=influx influxdb

The full story is in https://hub.docker.com/_/influxdb.

The web server is serving on port 8000. Again, this would be easy to change in
the code.

For a test run, you can start the web server (cargo run), launch an InfluxDB
and create a test database with 

curl -i -XPOST http://localhost:8086/query --data-urlencode q=CREATE DATABASE mydb

Then you should see the DB in http://localhost:8000/

To see some data, you can run a script like the following (in zsh)

for i in {0..100}; do echo $i; curl -i -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:8086/write\?db=mydb --data-binary "confidence,car_plate=SED-12,region=eu value=0.999"; sleep 1; done

and go to http://localhost:8086/influx/mydb/confidence/10s

This shows the last 10 seconds of measurements, which should be close to 10
measurements.
