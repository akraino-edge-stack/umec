This program is written in Rust, so you need the Rust compiler for it. The easiest is to install rustup and then do

	rustup update
	rustup install nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

The program has a dependency on the nightly build and uses a directory override. so it does not matter what the default is. To activate the toolchain in the directory, type

	cargo override nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

To compile, run 

	cargo build

To run the progrm, run

	cargo run

To install locally, 

	cargo install
